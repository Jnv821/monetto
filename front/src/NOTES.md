# **NOTES**

- **/api** : will have all the API calls.
  
- **/components** : here are all the components we will be using in /pages.
  *I recommend writing the component css inside an object and the pages css inside the /styles folder*

- **/pages** : has the pages that will be render at specific routes.

- **/styles** : here we are putting all the styles for the pages.

- **/utils** : here we are putting Providers we are creating / custom hooks etc...

# **TODOS & Things to consider**

- We should install prettier and create a .prettierrc file to format our code.

- Start refactoring the components and rewrite the css where is necessary

- Create a seperate .css file inside the **/styles** for each Page

- We should also refactor also the register/login forms. They are pretty mess now

- For now everything is simple and doing the bare minimum to have a basic functionality (login/register/signout etc). As we will developing we will be adding more complexity and refactor the code.
